# Docker CCompile Benchy
Docker Ccompile benchy is a benchmark tool for testing different container environments.
It does this by providing a slim container image tasked with compiling php-src and measuring the time needed aswell as ram/cpu usage.

This tool was developed by me for my Bachelor Thesis Software Engineering @Howest
